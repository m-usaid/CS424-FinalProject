## CS 424: Joy of Theoretical Computer Science
## Final Project 
### Geometric Algorithms: The Convex Hull Problem in 2 & 3 Dimensions

#### Group Members:
- M. Usaid Rehman (mr04302)
- Syed Anus Ali (aa04928)
- Faraz Ozair (mo05005) 

#### Overview:
This is a research based project that focuses on us doing an extensive
literature review on a particular topic in theoretical computer science. 
Since we were interested in computational geometry, we chose the convex hull
problem - a problem that has a variety of uses and has been studied extensively 
over the last few decades. 

We focused on the the problem itself, its theoretical background and the 
different algorithms that exist to solve it, for example: Jarvis March, 
Graham Scan, and Quickhull.
